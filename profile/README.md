WrestleMania 41 Night 1 main event will see CM Punk, Roman Reigns and Seth Rollins collide in a triple threat match. Paul Heyman will be in Punkâ€™s corner after the Second City Saint revealed his favor previously on SmackDown. Elsewhere on the card, Gunther will defend his world title against 2025 Menâ€™s Royal Rumble winner Jey Uso. Click here to read our analysis of this feud.

The other world title match on the undercard for Saturday will see Tiffany Stratton put her WWE Womenâ€™s Championship on the line against 2025 Womenâ€™s Royal Rumble winner Charlotte Flair. Both women reportedly went way off script during their promo exchange previously on SmackDown, prompting WWE to initiate disciplinary action against the pair.

The final singles title matches of the night will see LA Knight defend his United States Championship against Jacob Fatu. As for the tag team titles, reigning World Tag Team Champions War Raiders will be in action against The New Day.

The remaining two matches on the Saturday card are Jade Cargill versus Naomi and Rey Mysterio against El Grande Americano. Jade returned to WWE at Elimination Chamber 2025 to set up her feud with Naomi, who later admitted to attacking the former one-half of the Womenâ€™s Tag Team Champion.

Speaking of an admission, Rey Mysterio wants El Grande Americano to admit heâ€™s Chad Gable in disguise. WWE faced backlash from the Mexican community for their AI video explaining Americanoâ€™s controversial origins in the lead-up to WrestleMania 41 Night 1.

John Cena and Cody Rhodes will battle for the Undisputed WWE Championship in the main event of WrestleMania 41 Night 2. Cena turned heel in the build-up to this feud by attacking Cody at Elimination Chamber 2025, aligning himself with The Rock in the process. The Final Boss hasnâ€™t graced us with his presence, as Punk would say, since the March PLE.

The other world title match on the card will see defending champion IYO SKY collide against Bianca Belair and Rhea Ripley in a triple threat match. IYO defeated Rhea for the Womenâ€™s World Championship two days after Bianca won the 2025 Womenâ€™s Elimination Chamber match. The EST would disqualify both women during their rematch on 3/31 RAW.

Elsewhere on the card, Bron Breakker will defend his WWE Intercontinental Championship in a fatal four-way match against Penta, Finn Balor and Dominik Mysterio. Plus, Liv Morgan and Raquel Rodriguez will put their Womenâ€™s Tag Team Championship on the line against Bayley and WWE Womenâ€™s Intercontinental Champion Lyra Valkyria.

Drew McIntyre will square off against Damian Priest in a Sin City Street Fight. McIntyre suffered an injury during his brawl with Priest on the penultimate SmackDown before WWE WrestleMania 41. The final non-title match of the night will see AJ Styles take on Logan Paul. Styles defeated Karrion Kross in singles action to prepare for his match against The Maverick this week on RAW.

WWE was forced to pull the plug on Randy Orton versus Kevin Owens due to KO suffering a neck injury. Orton seemingly teased a feud with this superstar after learning about his WrestleMania 41 status previously on SmackDown.
